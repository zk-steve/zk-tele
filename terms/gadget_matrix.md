# Gadget Matrix

A gadget matrix is a specially structured matrix used in lattice-based cryptography to simplify certain operations, particularly those
involving homomorphic encryption and digital signatures. These matrices enable efficient computation and transformation of
lattice-based problems.

## Characteristics of Gadget Matrices

1. **Structured Form**:
    - Gadget matrices typically have a simple and repetitive structure, making them easier to handle in computations. A common example
      is the use of powers of 2, such as $G = [1, 2, 4, \ldots, 2^{l}] \otimes I$.

2. **Transformation Simplification**:
    - They facilitate the conversion between different representations of lattice problems, such as reducing the dimensionality or
      transforming between spaces in a controlled manner.

3. **Auxiliary Tools**:
    - Gadget matrices act as auxiliary tools that aid in the design of cryptographic schemes, enabling operations like
      [preimage sampling](preimage_sampling.md) and modular arithmetic to be performed efficiently.

## Applications in Cryptography

1. **Homomorphic Encryption**:
    - In homomorphic encryption schemes, gadget matrices are used to encode and decode ciphertexts, allowing complex operations to be
      performed on encrypted data without decrypting it.

2. **Digital Signatures**:
    - Gadget matrices enable efficient key generation and signature creation by simplifying the underlying lattice problems. They help
      in constructing short, valid signatures that meet security requirements.

3. **Trapdoor Functions**:
    - Gadget matrices assist in the construction of trapdoor functions, where the trapdoor allows efficient inversion of a function
      that is otherwise hard to invert. This is useful in public-key encryption and digital signatures.

### Example: GSW Encryption Scheme

The Gentry-Sahai-Waters (GSW) homomorphic encryption scheme utilizes a gadget matrix for efficient encryption and decryption processes:

- **Encryption**: The plaintext is encoded using the gadget matrix $G$ and then encrypted.
- **Decryption**: The gadget matrix allows for efficient transformation and decoding of the ciphertext to retrieve the plaintext.

### Formal Definition

Let $g$ denote the gadget vector

$$
g = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 4 & \cdots & 2^{k-1}
\end{bmatrix}
\$$

where $k$ is the maximum length of the bit-decomposed values that we want to represent.

Then, $G = g \otimes I$

Basically, we can construct any matrix $G$ by stacking $g$ in a block-diagonal form:

$$
G = \begin{bmatrix}
g & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & g & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & g
\end{bmatrix}
$$

An example:

$$
G = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2
\end{bmatrix}
\otimes
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
